### Solution

#### Concepts Involved
This problem involves the Doppler effect, which describes the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. In this case, the source is a rotating sound emitter, and the observer is a microphone.

#### Given Data
- Frequency of the sound source, \\( f_0 = 1500 \\, \\text{Hz} \\)
- Radius of the circular path, \\( r = 40.0 \\, \\text{cm} = 0.4 \\, \\text{m} \\)
- The sound source is rotating in an anti-clockwise direction.

#### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Determine the angular velocity (\\( \\omega \\)) of the source:**

Since the source is rotating, we need to find its angular velocity. However, the problem does not provide the rotational speed directly. We will assume the tangential velocity \\( v \\) at the point of the source is given by \\( v = r \\omega \\).

2. **Calculate the Doppler shift for each position (a, b, c):**

The Doppler effect formula for sound is given by:

\\(f = f_0 \\left( \\frac{v + v_o}{v + v_s} \\right)\\)

where:
- \\( f \\) is the observed frequency.
- \\( f_0 \\) is the source frequency.
- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound in the medium.
- \\( v_o \\) is the observer's velocity relative to the medium.
- \\( v_s \\) is the source's velocity relative to the medium.

Since the observer (microphone) is stationary, \\( v_o = 0 \\).

3. **Frequency at point a:**

At point a, the source is moving towards the observer.
\\[f_a = f_0 \\left( \\frac{v}{v - v_s} \\right)\\]
where \\( v_s = r \\omega \\).

4. **Frequency at point b:**

At point b, the source is moving perpendicular to the line of sight of the observer.
\\[f_b = f_0\\]
There is no Doppler shift because the component of the velocity towards the observer is zero.

5. **Frequency at point c:**

At point c, the source is moving away from the observer.
\\[f_c = f_0 \\left( \\frac{v}{v + v_s} \\right)\\]
where \\( v_s = r \\omega \\).

6. **Compare the frequencies:**

From the Doppler effect formulas:
- \\( f_a > f_0 \\) because the source is moving towards the observer.
- \\( f_b = f_0 \\) because there is no relative motion towards or away from the observer.
- \\( f_c < f_0 \\) because the source is moving away from the observer.

Therefore, the relationship between the frequencies is:
\\(f_a > f_b = f_c\\)

### Conclusion
The frequencies perceived by the microphone are such that \\( f_a > f_b = f_c \\).
