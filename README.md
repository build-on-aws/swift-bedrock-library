# Amazon Bedrock Swift Library and web playground

This repository contains projects demonstrating how to use Amazon Bedrock with Swift.

## Projects

### 1. Swift Bedrock Library

A tiny layer on top of the [AWS SDK for Swift](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-swift) for interacting with Amazon Bedrock foundation models. This library provides a convenient way to access Amazon Bedrock's capabilities from Swift applications.

### 2. Swift FM Playground

An interactive web application that demonstrates the capabilities of Amazon Bedrock foundation models using the Swift Bedrock Library. The playground includes:

- A Swift "backend for frontend" that interfaces with Amazon Bedrock
- A React frontend for interacting with the models through a user-friendly interface
